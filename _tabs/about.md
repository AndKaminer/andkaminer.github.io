Hi! I'm Andrew. I'm a computer scientist and engineer 
pursuing a BS/MS in computer science at Georgia Tech. 

I came into college interested in security and low-level
systems (especially on the red team). Then, I got a bit 
sidetracked into ML. Now, I find myself working at their
intersection, particularly in making ML systems fast and
secure. I do have a soft spot for pure work in any of
those areas though.

I'm also casually interested in neat data structures and
algorithms, operating systems, networking, and assorted 
math. Even more casually, I enjoy books (mostly fiction)
and philosophy.

I love spending time outdoors. I compete as an athlete for
Georgia Tech's rowing team, and I spend the rest of my
time kayaking, climbing, or hiking. 

I'm currently an intern at The Trade Desk's Boulder CO 
office, working on the real-time bidding team.
